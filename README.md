# Simple Metagenomics
A BIOF501 term project for inferring protein annotations of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAG) from metagenomic reads hosted on [NCBI's sequence read archive (SRA)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra)

-------------------------

## For the Impatient
Setup:
```
pip install simple-metagenomics
smg setup -r ./ref
```
To run **with default subsampling** (to 1% of the original for improved runtime):
```
smg run -r ./ref -i SRR19573024 -o ./out
```
To run with **no subsampling**:
```
smg run -r ./ref -s 1 -i SRR19573024 -o ./out
```

## Background and Rationale

Throughout the various biomes of Earth, complex consortia of microorganisms thrive and cycle nutrients at scales ranging from symbiosis to global biogeochemical cycles. The study of these consortia has contributed to advances in many fields, including health in the context of host microbiomes [[1](#references)], renewable energy in the context of biofuels [[2](#references)], and ecology in the context of distributed metabolisms [[3](#references)]. Since only a select few microbes have been successfully cultured in laboratory conditions, the typical approach is to interrogate the microbial gene content of a sample directly using metagenomics.

The aim of this pipeline is to provide the simplest possible method for downloading and then converting raw metagenomic sequences into meaningful annotations. For additional details, please refer to the [implementation](#implementation) section.

## Usage

### **Manual Dependencies**

- Linux OS/amd64
- [Singularity](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/2.6/user-guide/installation.html)
- Either Anaconda or Python version>=3.4 (so that you have pip)

[install Mamba (multithreaded Anaconda)](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)<br>
[install Miniconda (smaller install)](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)<br>
[install Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)<br>

### **Installation**
We recommend that you use a virtual environment

via conda...<br>
```
conda create --no-default-packages --name smg python=3 -y
conda activate smg
```

**or** via venv
```
pip install venv
python -m venv ./smg
source ./smg/bin/activate

```

In the environment, install simple metagenomics
```
pip install simple-metagenomics
```

Select a folder to save additional reference resources (`./ref`).
```
smg setup -r ./ref
```

### **Execution**

Obtain the SRA run ID for a whole genome metagenomics sequencing entry. For example, we use `SRR19573024`, which points to reads for a cyanobacteria bioreactor community [[4](#references)]. `./ref` refers to the same folder used in the last installation step.<br>
[Example search](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=(%22metagenome%22%5BOrganism%5D)%20AND%20%22wgs%22%5BStrategy%5D)

```
smg run -r ./ref -i SRR19573024 -o ./out
```

Once complete, look for annotation tables under `./out/SRR19573024/diamond/`.<br>
*Expected runtime: ~30 minutes with 16 threads and subsampled to 1%, but can be longer than 3 hours depending your internet.*

Expected output:<br>

    ./out                       # base output path specified with "-o"
    ????????? .snakemake              # snakemake generated files, including logs
    ????????? snakemake               # snakemake cache
    ????????? SRR19573024
        ????????? sra_raw             # original fastqs from SRA
        ????????? input               # subsampled fastqs
        ????????? megahit             # intermediate metagenomic assembly
        ????????? maxbin2             # intermediate bins
        ????????? prodigal            # intermediate ORFs per bin
        ????????? diamond
            ????????? 001.fasta.tsv   # annotation table for 1 bin
            ????????? 002.fasta.tsv   # 2 bins should be resolved from SRR19573024 by default

Columns: Query ID (ORF), Subject title (annotation), Percentage of identical matches, Expected value <br><br>
Interestingly, photosynthesis genes were found in both bins, including photosystems I and II. Bin 001, however, showed a greater potential to fix nitrogen since nifB, nifS, and nifU were identified which accounts for 3 out of the 4 genes of a known nitrogen fixation operon [[5](#references)]. While the remaining gene, fdxN, was not explicitly identified, a ferredoxin nitrite reductase was found instead. Only nifB was found in bin 002.

            The workflow is managed by snakemake [<a href="#references">6</a>] with all workflow-related dependencies packaged into a Docker container to maximize reproducibiltiy. Due to its' rising popularity, especially in the research community, Singularity [<a href="#references">7</a>] may be used as an alternative to Docker. The container image is hosted on <a href="https://quay.io/repository/txyliu/simple-metagenomics">Quay.io</a> and automatically pulled during setup.

            <b>sra_download:</b> Using <a href="https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools/wiki">sra toolkit</a>, we download the paired-end fastq reads pointed to by the given SRA run ID.
